# Dongbu-s-HerkuleX-DRS-0101-Servo-Motor-Interfacing
MATLAB Library for Dongbu's HerkuleX DRS-0101 Servo Motor
This library covers the codes needed for more in-depth and flexible control of Dongbu's HerkuleX DRS-0101 Servo Motor, including command packet construction, sending packet to motor, multiple motor control, etc.
The codes were used in the development of the NTU Final Year Project, Robotics Technologies for Additive Manufacturing, under Prof. Domenico Campolo.
